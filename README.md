# Real-Estate-Market-Analysis-And-Prediction-SQL-Python-Project

## Overview

This project explores **USA real estate market trends** using **SQL (SQLite)** and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**. The analysis uncovers how factors like **location, number of bedrooms, garage size, pools, build year, and distance to the city center** affect home prices.

The goal is not just to explore — but to predict:  
**Which homes are undervalued and likely to grow in future market value?**

---

##  Project Objectives

- Identify key drivers of house prices
- Uncover market trends based on home features
- Visualize insights for investors & analysts
- Predict **growth potential** of individual homes

## Key Analyses & Insights

1. **Top 10 Most Expensive Houses**
2. **Average Price by Bedroom Count**
3. **Price Trend Over Build Year**
4. **3D Surface: Distance to Center vs Price**
5. **Garage Size vs Price**
6. **Pool vs No Pool — Price Impact**

9. **Top 10 Houses by Location Score**
10. **Decade-wise House Construction Trend**
11. **Growth Potential Score** – *Predicting which houses will likely appreciate*

##  Predicting Growth Potential

To go beyond standard EDA, we built a custom **Growth Potential Score** using:

- High Location Score  
- Presence of Garden / Pool 
- Garage Size 
- Low Price per Square Foot   


Growth_Score = (Location_Score * 0.4)
             + (20 if Garden)
             + (15 if Pool)
             + (Garage_Size * 0.1)
             - (Relative Price per SqFt)

## Final Reflection
This project combined SQL logic with Python storytelling to answer real questions that buyers, sellers, and investors care about.

> Data doesn't lie. And in real estate — price ≠ size, it's about features, feel, and foundation.
